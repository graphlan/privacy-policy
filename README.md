# Graphlan, Inc. Privacy Policy

Welcome to **www.graphlan.com** (the "**Site**”), a website operated by Graphlan, Inc. ("**Graphlan**”, "**Graphlan**”, "**we**”, "**us**”, or "**our**”).

We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information relating to our users’ interactions with our products and services, whether users are simply visiting our Site or using any of our related products and services ("**Services**”).

IF YOU ARE A NON-U.S. USER OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, BY VISITING THE SITE, USING THE SERVICES AND/OR PROVIDING US WITH INFORMATION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSES IDENTIFIED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY VISITING THE SITE, USING THE SERVICES AND/OR PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT MAY HAVE LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

The term "**Personal Information**,” as used in this Privacy Policy, means contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. The term "**Anonymous Information**,” as used in this Privacy Policy, means information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

## How We Handle Information About Children

The Site and Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Site or Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. When the Site or Services collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site or Services.

## How We Collect Information

### Personal Information

In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Site and Services to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily when you register with us or when you use the Site or Services. We also collect Personal Information from any third party who may submit such Personal Information to us (e.g., a user who provides us with your Personal Information when registering or inviting multiple individuals to use the Services). To create an "**Account**” with a user name, we require certain Personal Information, including a name and email address. In order for a third party to create an Account on your behalf, we may require your Personal Information so that you may have access to certain features of the Site or Services. Any third party registering on your behalf is responsible for obtaining any and all necessary consents from you prior to submitting such Personal Information. All payments on the Site are processed by our service providers who collect your credit card information directly, and we will not have access to or see your credit card information as part of such transaction. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Site or Services you are able to use.

In order for us to provide access to certain features or functions of the Services, we may require users to access the Services through a third-party platform ("**Third-Party Platform**”), using users’ existing account and log-in credentials on such Third-Party Platform. If you elect to proceed after receiving a prompt from us to enter your Third-Party Platform credentials, you are granting us and our Services access to your information on such Third-Party Platform. Further, by accessing, using, or interacting with the Services through a Third-Party Platform (whether or not you are using your account for such Third-Party Platform), you should also refer to that Third-Party Platform’s terms of use, as you will be subject to those terms of use as well. We receive and use information uploaded, posted, provided, communicated, or otherwise made available from the Third-Party Platform to make it easier for you to create an account with us and to offer and improve the Site and Services. The information that we collect from a Third-Party Platform account through which you access, use or interact with the Services, may depend on the privacy settings for that Third-Party Platform, so please consult the Third Party-Platform’s privacy and data practices.

When you send an email or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.

### Anonymous Information

**_Information Collected by Our Servers._** Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol ("**IP**”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, clickstream data, and a date/time stamp for your visit.

**_Cookies._** Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience through our Site and/or Services. This type of information is collected to make the Site and/or Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Site and/or Services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site and/or Services.

**_Pixel Tags._** In addition, we use pixel tags (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to help us send messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.

**_Collection of Information by Advertisers._** We may use third parties to serve ads on the Site and/or Services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to the Site and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number). They do this by using cookies or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site, Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or pixel tags in third-party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: [**http://www.aboutads.info/choices**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

**_Disclosure – Third-Party Cookies._** We use third-party services such as Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site and/or Services. These services use cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and/or Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site and/or using the Services. We use the information we get from these service providers to improve our Site and/or Services. They generally collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site and/or use the Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine this information with your Personal Information. The service provider’s ability to use and share information it collects is restricted by its applicable terms and privacy policy.

## Information Disclosed to Third Parties

This Privacy Policy addresses our use and disclosure of information we collect relating to our users’ interactions with our Site and Services. If you disclose information to others, including payment processors, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. The use and disclosure restrictions contained in this Privacy Policy will not apply to any third party. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.

The Site and/or Services may contain links to other websites and/or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed via such other websites and/or services. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and/or Services and go to another site or service. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Information or Anonymous Information from you. The Site and/or Services may also contain links to other websites or services controlled by us but that operate under different privacy policies. Please review the privacy policy of any new website you visit or service you use.

If you have an Account with us, you may update certain of your Personal Information on our Site. You may also email us at **contact@graphlan.com**. You may request that we delete your Personal Information, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives and we may also retain Personal Information about your use of our Site and/or Services. Once we disclose some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the third parties to which we have made those disclosures.
